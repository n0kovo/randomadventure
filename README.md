# randomadventure
(this is very old)

randomadventure is a really badly coded Python script, that will pick a random episode of Adventure Time and open the episode for streaming, using a popular streaming website. Real randomness provided by random.org.

NOTE: Functionality if broken as something changed with the sreaming provider. It shouldn't be hard to adapt it for some other site though.
